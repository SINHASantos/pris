# Name

Pris is named after Pris Stratton, the Blade Runner character in turn based on
the character from Dick’s 1968 novel *Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?*.
The fact that ‘Pris’ sounds like a prefix of ‘presentation’ might or might not
have something to do with it. The fact that `pris` is a nice and short name for
a command-line application is entirely coincidental.
