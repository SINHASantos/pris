## 0.1.0

Released 2017-04-20.

Highlights:

 * The color and width of lines can now be set.
 * The background color of a slide can now be set.
 * Text support (including ligatures and alignment).
 * Frames now have an “anchor”, which is used for the adjoin operator (`~`).
 * Escape sequences can be used inside strings.
 * There is a new `image` function that can load svg images.
 * Support for scaling frames with the `fit` function.
 * The bounding box of frames is now exposed, allowing lay out computations.

Pris 0.1.0 was usable (though not convenient) for making simple slides.
